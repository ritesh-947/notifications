      <h2>How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>In Short:</strong> We are committed to protecting your personal information through a combination of technical and organizational security measures.
      </p>
      <p>
        WanLoft employs robust security protocols to safeguard your personal data, including session history, profile information, timezone data, and chat data against unauthorized access and misuse. Our data security measures include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Message (Queries) Encryption and User Anonymity:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              To ensure user privacy, we encrypt messages sent between users and session creators. For users who choose to send messages anonymously, we take additional steps to ensure that message content is not linked back to their identity.
            </li>
            <li>
              Access to sensitive data, such as messages and interaction records, is restricted to authorized personnel and safeguarded by encryption and secure access controls.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Encryption and Secure Storage:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We implement robust encryption technologies and secure storage solutions to protect your information, including sensitive data such as session interactions, messages exchanged during video sessions, user IDs, attendance records, scheduling details, and profile information. This ensures confidentiality and protection against unauthorized access throughout transmission and storage.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ratings, reviews, and other session-related data are transmitted using secure protocols, with encryption applied as needed to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of data during transit and storage.
            </li>
            <li>
              Session interactions—including ratings, reviews, and messages—are encrypted, providing an additional layer of security so that only authorized users have access. This helps to prevent unauthorized access and ensures that only intended recipients can view or modify your content.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Controlled Access and Authentication:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Access to sensitive data, including session bookings, interaction records, and any stored data, is restricted to authenticated users and authorized personnel. We use secure access protocols, including JWT tokens for authentication, to verify identities and control access.
            </li>
            <li>
              Information stored in cookies, session history, and other interaction data is accessible only to authenticated users, and secure protocols are in place to protect your data during interactions on the platform.
            </li>
            <li>
              Real-Time Security Protocols: WebSocket connections are managed using secure protocols to prevent unauthorized access and ensure that all real-time communications remain private and secure.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Secure Authentication with JWTs:</strong> We use secure tokens, specifically JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), to verify user identities and control access to platform features. These tokens enable secure and efficient authentication, ensuring only authorized users can access certain data or perform specific actions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rate Limiting and Input Validation:</strong> We apply rate limiting and input validation on our platform to prevent misuse, safeguard against automated attacks, and ensure that data such as video URLs and session titles adhere to security and content standards. This helps us detect and block potentially malicious requests, protecting the integrity of your data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Regular Security Reviews:</strong> We continually monitor and review our security practices to detect and prevent unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of your data. We employ security best practices and update our systems regularly to address new risks and vulnerabilities. Regular audits and vulnerability assessments help us stay ahead of emerging threats and ensure the safety of your information.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        While we take significant steps to protect your information, please remember that no method of electronic transmission or storage is entirely secure. By using WanLoft, you acknowledge and accept the inherent risks associated with online data transmission. We encourage you to protect your data by using strong passwords, managing your privacy settings, and ensuring the security of your devices when accessing WanLoft.

      <h2>Controls for Do-Not-Track Features</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>In Short:</strong> At this time, WanLoft does not respond to Do-Not-Track (DNT) signals as no standard has been established.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile devices offer a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature you can enable to signal your preference not to have data about your online activities tracked. Currently, there is no standardized approach for recognizing DNT signals, and therefore, WanLoft does not respond to these signals or other similar mechanisms. Should a DNT standard be established that we are required to follow, we will update this privacy notice accordingly.
