        <p>
          
You agree to resolve disputes with Wanloft through binding arbitration, which means an arbitrator will decide the dispute, not a judge or jury. This Agreement waives the right to participate in any class action.

27.1 Covered Disputes

Any dispute or claim arising out of or related to this Agreement or the Services will be resolved by binding arbitration, except as described in Section 27.2 below. This includes disputes arising before or after the termination of this Agreement.

27.2 Exceptions to Arbitration

The following claims are not subject to arbitration:

	•	Small claims court actions meeting jurisdictional limits;
	•	Intellectual property claims.

27.3 Informal Dispute Resolution

Before initiating arbitration, you agree to attempt to resolve disputes informally by submitting a Pre-Arbitration Demand to Wanloft. The demand must include your contact details, a description of the dispute, and your signature. Wanloft will respond similarly, and if unresolved within 60 days, arbitration may proceed.
27.4 Arbitration Procedure

If, after completing the informal dispute resolution process outlined in Section 27.3, either you or Wanloft wishes to initiate arbitration, the initiating party must provide the other party with a demand for arbitration. The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) will govern this Arbitration Agreement; if the FAA does not apply, then state arbitration laws of your residence will govern.

The applicable arbitration provider depends on your location. For residents in California, arbitration will be administered by ADR Services, Inc. (“ADR Services”). For all others, arbitration will be administered by National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”). Arbitration hearings will default to videoconferencing unless otherwise agreed in writing. The arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes, except for the enforceability of the Mass Action Waiver (Section 27.6), which will be resolved in court.

27.5 Jury Trial Waiver

You and Wanloft waive any rights to a jury trial for disputes covered by this Arbitration Agreement. Disputes will instead be resolved by an arbitrator, providing a streamlined process compared to court litigation.

27.6 Mass Action Waiver

You agree to bring any claims on an individual basis only, not as part of any class or collective action. If a court finds this waiver unenforceable for a specific claim, then that claim alone may proceed in court.

27.7 Bellwether Arbitrations

For efficiency, if fifty (50) or more individual arbitration demands of a similar nature are filed within a 180-day period by or with the same law firm or organization, the parties will select sixteen (16) individual demands to proceed first as “Bellwether Arbitrations.” The remaining claims will be held until the Bellwether Arbitrations are resolved. Wanloft will cover arbitration costs for these selected cases, and all other demands are tolled until after the Bellwether Arbitrations and subsequent mediation.

After Bellwether Arbitrations, if a global resolution is not reached, remaining demands will proceed individually, unless otherwise agreed. This provision is not to be construed as authorizing any form of collective action but aims to ensure efficient processing of claims with similar issues.

27.8 Settlement Offers and Offers of Judgment

At least ten (10) calendar days before the arbitration hearing date, either you or Wanloft may serve a written offer of judgment to allow a judgment based on specified terms. If accepted, the offer with proof of acceptance will be submitted to the arbitration provider for judgment. If the offer is not accepted before the hearing or within thirty (30) days of being made, it is deemed withdrawn and cannot be used as evidence. Should an offer be refused and the refusing party does not obtain a more favorable award, they may be responsible for the offering party’s post-offer costs, which could include reasonable attorney fees within statutory limits, up to the awarded damages.

For disputes involving Mass Filings, settlement offers or offers of judgment will be resolved by a single arbitrator, assuming similar material terms. Attorneys representing multiple parties must communicate settlement offers or offers of judgment to each individual involved in arbitration.

27.9 Arbitration Costs

Outside of Mass Filings, arbitration costs, including filing and arbitrator fees, will follow the arbitration provider’s rules. If your gross monthly income is less than 300% of the federal poverty guidelines, you may qualify for a waiver of certain arbitration fees.

27.10 Requirement to File Within One Year

Except as otherwise permitted by Law, any claim or cause of action under this Agreement (excluding those under Section 27.2(2)) must be filed within one (1) year of the incident. Any limitations and deadlines will be tolled during the informal dispute resolution process outlined in Section 27.3.

27.11 Opt-Out

You may opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement by emailing Wanloft at opt-out@wanloft.com within thirty (30) days of creating your account. Your notice must include your full name, address, the email associated with your account, and a statement declining arbitration. Opting out will only apply to this Arbitration Agreement and does not affect any future agreements you may enter into with Wanloft.

27.12 Severability

If any part of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will still apply, with the original intent upheld as closely as possible, excluding the invalid section.
